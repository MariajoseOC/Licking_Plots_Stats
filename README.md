Microstructure of Licking Analysis in Rats
Sex differences, sugar familiarization, and sweetener generalization

This repository contains Python scripts and analysis tools used to study the microstructure of licking behavior in adult male and female rats exposed to sucrose, fructose, saccharin, and water. The project quantifies motivational and appetitive components of ingestion using high-resolution licking data.

📌 Summary of the Study

Previous research shows that rats highly familiarized with sugar display:

delayed acquisition of taste aversion

rapid extinction of aversive memory

difficulty associating negative consequences with sugar

compulsive patterns of intake

However, total intake alone does not capture differences between familiarized vs. non-familiarized rats.

This project analyzes licking microstructure, focusing on:

burst duration

cluster size

inter-burst interval (IBI)

total licks per 8-minute block

sex differences

effects of sugar familiarization

Main Findings

Clear sex-dependent effects, with females showing stronger alterations.

Preference generalizes not only to sucrose, but to fructose and saccharin as well.

Sucrose induces more reinforcing behavior than fructose, reflected by shorter IBI.

Experimental intervention alters intra-burst satiety (cluster size) in males.

IBI remains a robust metric distinguishing sucrose vs. fructose across groups.

These results highlight how early and prolonged exposure to sugar or sweeteners may affect:

satiety

motivation

learning

dopaminergic circuitry

compulsive intake

risk of metabolic and cognitive disorders
